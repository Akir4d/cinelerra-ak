This is the Cinelerra CV Manual.

It is based on "Secrets of Cinelerra", an excellent manual written by Heroine
Virtual Ltd. Alex Ferrer's TWiki contents was put in by Nicolas Maufrais, who
worked on the original cinelerra.texi file in order to generate nice manuals.

To fetch the manual sources:
cg-clone git://scm.pipapo.org/cinelerra/nicolasm

To make the manuals in PDF, HTML and TXT formats, just execute:
./make_manuals.sh <language code>
Example: ./make_manuals.sh en

Dependency: texinfo has to be installed on your computer.

The manual can also be converted to Docbook, but you need the CVS version of
texinfo to do so. The "stable" version of Texinfo cannot produce a correct
Docbook file. If you have the binary of the CVS version of makeinfo available
on your computer, you can uncomment the corresponding lines in make_manuals.sh
That will produce a Docbook cinelerra.xml file which can be opened by yelp.
CAUTION: Do not deinstall your current stable version of texinfo. If you want
to look at the manual in yelp, just download the texinfo CVS sources and make
the binaries. Here is what you should do:
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/texinfo co texinfo
$ cd texinfo
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
$ make

You will get compilation errors. Do not worry about that. Do *NOT* proceed to
the makeinfo CVS install. All you need is the makeinfo binary, which is in the
makeinfo folder.  Rename it to makeinfo_cvs for example and copy it your path.
