Compressor can use sum of all channels in addition to highest channel
and trigger.









Channel mapping for the AC3/A52 decoder is fixed for 5.1 channels.
Liba52 outputs LFE, FL, C, FR, BL, BR but every other library expects 
C, FL, FR, BL, BR, LFE, which caused errors when the BR channel from 
liba52 was encoded straight through as LFE.






Fullscreen video in compositor window, recording monitor.  Lots of new
menu options in the compositor popup.

Tabs instead of pulldown menu for changing preferences dialogs.

MPEG-2 decoding directly from unencrypted Blu-Ray disks.

Option to match project frame rate in asset popup.

For overlaying, divide behavior is the same as the Gimp.
New overlaying algorithm: Max takes the maximum r, g, and b values.
