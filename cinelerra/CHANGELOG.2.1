Overlay audio effect.  Allows applying compression to the result of a
6 -> 2 mixdown in realtime.

Compressor can use sum of all channels in addition to highest channel
and trigger.

Channel position recall based on number of channels.

Audio recording uses another layer of buffers to handle the extremely
small ALSA buffers better.
ALSA support migrated to version 1.0.11 and using the dynamic library since
it is now installed by default.




Filename extension automatically changed when selecting file format.

Toggles for effect on/show.

Motion tracking controls width and height for the block and range
instead of just size. Motion tracking takes the previous keyframe's x
and y instead of interpolating them.

Channel mapping for the AC3/A52 decoder is fixed for 5.1 channels.
Liba52 outputs LFE, FL, C, FR, BL, BR but every other library expects 
C, FL, FR, BL, BR, LFE, which caused errors when the BR channel from 
liba52 was encoded straight through as LFE.

2 presets for audio mixing positions.  Map each track to a different
channel and map 5.1 tracks to stereo.


Background drawing of tracks for more responsiveness.

Number of channels is no longer set in device configuration but totally
dependant on project settings.

Automatic cursor hiding when video is playing back.

Fullscreen video in compositor window, recording monitor.  Lots of new
menu options in the compositor popup.

A floating point boundary condition in Linearize was fixed, defeating
the color glitches that would show up many steps later in floating
point images.

Smarter timebar drawing.

Tabs instead of pulldown menu for changing preferences dialogs.

Keyframes->Straighten curves: straightens the bezier curves if more than one
curve keyframe is in the highlighted area.

W and H may be swapped by a single button in the project settings.

MPEG-2 decoding directly from unencrypted Blu-Ray disks.

Option to match project frame rate in asset popup.
Asset info gives bitrate of actual MPEG stream instead of table of
contents file.

TOC rebuilt if source MPG file changes date.

Antialiased fonts for the interface.

Colorbalance ranges changed to more easily support white balancing.

Histogram shows the output of the RGB transfer in the value plot,
because the value transfer is applied after the RGB transfer.
 - Histogram has split output

Limited DVD subtitle support.  Requires starting playback before the
subtitle appears.  The number of subtitle tracks are given in the asset
info dialog for MPEG video files.

Full OpenGL support during playback for compositing and effects. 
 - Some effects can't be useful and software isn't catching up to hardware.
 - Requires OpenGL 2.0 drivers which only NVidia supports currently.
 - Selected effects have been OpenGL enabled but most have not.  
 - OpenGL allows higher video resolution than Xv can handle.
 - OpenGL enabled effects must be placed after software-only effects to get the hardware
acceleration.
 - The OpenGL routines are not very optimized.  You can get in the code
and fix that.
 - Histogram only uses OpenGL if no channel has more than 3 points.
 - Histogram effects only use OpenGL if the
 GUI is closed or the histogram plot is disabled.
 - Certain frame sizes don't work in OpenGL.  If they're not multiples of 4.
 - Most effect sequences have 8 bit intermediates.
 - Certain effect sequences don't have 8 bit intermediates.
 	- Interpolate Pixels->Linearize->Color Balance->Histogram
	- Frames to Fields->RGB601
 - Multichannel effects should set discarded outputs to TEXTURE.
 - PBuffers are unreliable.  It may take advancing 2 frames or restarting for 
 	an OpenGL operation to take effect.

The following effects support OpenGL:
brightness
chromakey
chromakeyhsv
colorbalance
deinterlace
diffkey
dissolve
flip
frames to fields
freezeframe
gamma
gradient
histogram
huesaturation
interpolate Pixels
invertvideo
linearblur
overlay
perspective
radialblur
rgb601
rotate
scale
threshold
zoomblur




The line doubling options in Frames to Fields and Freezeframe were
removed to simplify things.  Use deinterlace after freezeframe.  Frames
to Fields always averages lines.

Rounding error in picon drawing for long timelines fixed.

Handy error dialog pops up showing errors that would previously only
appear on the console.

Gradient in floating point doesn't stair step anymore.
Gradient with changing alpha works when colormodel doesn't have alpha.

Chromakey with hue/saturation/value is back, in addition to the color
cube method and difference key.


For overlaying, divide behavior is the same as the Gimp.
New overlaying algorithm: Max takes the maximum r, g, and b values.
