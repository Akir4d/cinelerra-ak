        - Modified:    cinelerra/hvirtual/cinelerra mainundo.C mainundo.h
        - Undo items are only pushed if some time has passed since the last push.

        - Modified:    cinelerra/hvirtual/cinelerra mainundo.C mainundo.h
                        pluginclient.C pluginserver.C pluginserver.h
        - This enables undo of plugin parameter tweaks. Fixes Bug 154.


        - Modified:    cinelerra/hvirtual/cinelerra mainundo.C mwindowedit.C
                        undostackitem.C undostackitem.h
        - The UndoStackItem::redo() is dropped and replaced by UndoStackItem::undo().
          The latter must reverse its state so that the next invocation does a redo.

        - Modified:    cinelerra/hvirtual/cinelerra mainundo.C mainundo.h
        - Only one project state is stored in an undo item instead of two.

        - Modified:    cinelerra/hvirtual/cinelerra loadfile.C mwindow.C
        - The invokers of MWindow::load_filenames() instead of this function itself
          mark the project unchanged.
          Exception: When a backup is loaded, the project remains marked as changed.

        - Modified:    cinelerra/hvirtual/cinelerra Makefile.am mainundo.C
                        mainundo.h
        - Removed:     cinelerra/hvirtual/cinelerra undostack.C undostack.h
                        undostack.inc
        - The undo stack is split into an undo stack and a redo stack.
          This makes class UndoStack unnecessary.
