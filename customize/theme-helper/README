If you cinecutie suv theme and you want to make also new theme easly:

http://www.tuttoainternet.it/kit/cinelerra-theme-helper.tar.gz
it needs inkscape to works. It's tested an cinelerra 2.1.5 and works
It's easy to use:
unpack cinelerra-theme-helper.tar.gz on cinelerra root source
than cd on cinelerra-theme-helper
there is two scripts
./global_updater.sh

that changes folder and files icons on source and
./buildtheme.sh
that makes theme from model on (model/MODEL)
the theme compiling from svg source placed on model named MODEL
on exemple there are suv.dtheme new like cinecutie but with cinelerra logo

if you want to change colors only edit .dtheme on themes/ but if you 
want to change appearance you must edit svg model/MODEL make new theme. ...
example on theme/suv.dtheme
after installing a new theme must be edited check if Makefile.am on ./plugins and configure.in contain your theme name
./build_theme also install plugins theme on ./plugins

compile cinelerra!

that's all!
