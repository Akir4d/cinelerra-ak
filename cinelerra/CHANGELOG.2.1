Compressor can use sum of all channels in addition to highest channel
and trigger.









Channel mapping for the AC3/A52 decoder is fixed for 5.1 channels.
Liba52 outputs LFE, FL, C, FR, BL, BR but every other library expects 
C, FL, FR, BL, BR, LFE, which caused errors when the BR channel from 
liba52 was encoded straight through as LFE.

Fullscreen video in compositor window, recording monitor.  Lots of new

Handy error dialog pops up showing errors that would previously only
appear on the console.




For overlaying, divide behavior is the same as the Gimp.
