<H1>Step 1: Build the library</H1><P>

The entire source code tree should be positioned in a location where
every application that needs it can access it.  There is no provision
for standard include files and normally it's much to difficult for
users to match versions to use it as a shared library.  Those of you
who were around in 1997 may remember QT doing this.<P>

Run make.  Make automatically configures itself.  The output is put in
i686/libquicktime.a.  You should manually set the CFLAGS environment
variable with the optimum optimization parameters for your i686
derivative.<P>
