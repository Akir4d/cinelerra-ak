Quicktime movies are first and foremost a very sophisticated wrapper
for 3rd party compression schemes.  While not belonging to the umbrella
of official Microsoft software, it is well documented and it supports
files longer than 4 GB.<P>

Quicktime for Linux hides the structure of a Quicktime movie and gives
the programmer a set of audio and video streams with some compression
ability.  The audio tracks are sequential streams of PCM audio data and
video tracks are a sequential streams of frames.<P>

Before you drop your classes and write up your dream program on this be
aware of some limitations.  This library doesn't give you the official
Quicktime API.  It uses an ANSI C API.  This library doesn't include
any commercial codecs or compressed header support.  This library only
reads uncompressed headers.<P>

What you can do is create and read any Quicktime movie using certain
compression formats.  You can still access raw data if you want to
write your own compression routines.<P>

Quicktime for Linux doesn't officially use <B>plugins</B> to achieve
functionality although there is some unfinished code for handling
plugins.  The philosophy behind this is that users can easily access
the complete library and source code over the internet and the library
is always updated more frequently than the codecs.  Plugins are more
convenient when the library is only available on hard media or requires
upgrade licenses for every download, which it doesn't.<P>
