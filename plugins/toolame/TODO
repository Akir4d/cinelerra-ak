toolame v0.3 TODO file

	- PRIORITY: Clean up the source code good and proper.
	    floats or doubles?
            mem allocation
	    remove superfluous defines and values (e.g. layer 3 tables etc)
	    Fix any mem leaks. (dmalloc)
            Partition functions/files in a 'sensible' way.
	    Have a nice structure for all our control variables.
	    Have a nice structure for all the encoding variables.
	    Pass the whole thing through a prettifier 
	    Update the usage()
            Rename some variables to make more sense. (e.g. fr_ps)
	         frame_params struct can probably include psy model,
		 input output filename. num samples. sblimit.
		 current bitstream(*bs)
		 rename: frame_info_struct *frame. rather than
			 frame_params *fr_ps. (more sensible?)
	    Add a version string.            
	    A configure script?
	    A proper makefile?
	    Get the warnings going and remove them all.
	    Better diagnostic printouts.
	    Work out why the tonal_label() function doesn't work properly for mpeg2-lsf

	- Optimization
  	    Just a few of the major ones at first: e.g. add_db(), fft().
