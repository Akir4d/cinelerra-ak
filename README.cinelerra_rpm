Cinelerra 1.2.0
===============

You'll need packages listed below under 'Other packages needed on SuSE 9.0
', plus these for 1.2.0 (the -devel versions only if you want to build
from source):

http://packman.links2linux.org/?action=217
 alsa-1.0.4-0.pm.0.i586.rpm   (for binary)
 alsa-devel-1.0.4-0.pm.0.i586.rpm

http://packman.links2linux.org/?action=287
 faad2-2.0rc1-1.i586.rpm   (for binary)
 faad2-devel-2.0rc1-1.i586.rpm
 -or-
 faad2-2.0rc1-1.i686.rpm

RPM builds in CVS
=================

Original RPM patch was developed for SuSE 9.0.  These are some notes...

To build an rpm package, check the .spec file.  You should change packager
to your name, and possibly talk to me about version stamping if you plan
to distribute your package.

You should be able to build an rpm binary and source package from a clean cvs
checkout by doing:

> autoreconf -i
> ./configure
> make dist 
> rpmbuild -ta cinelerra-1.1.9.tar.gz

If you have older rpm, then the rpm command will look something like 'rpm -ta'
instead.  rpmbuild seems to be a newer split of the build and install portions
of rpm.  Check the man page.


SuSE 9.0 RPMs
=============

I have binary and source packages up from recent cvs at
http://kevb.net/files/RPM/ .  The notes below apply to those files.

libavc1394-0.4.1-1.i586.rpm
cinelerra-1.1.9-?.i586.rpm

SuSE ships with libavc 0.3.1.  The firewire capture fixes in 0.4.1 are
recommended for use with cinelerra from cvs.  The libavc here is a combo
binary and dev package.  You may need to remove libavc1394-devel using yast2.

cinelerra normally supplies mpeg3dump, mpeg3cat, and mpeg3toc.  However, the
SuSE libmpeg3 supplies these also.  I left them out of this cinelerra RPM.
This is subject to change, as I'm debating how to handle this best.

You may need additional RPMs not supplied here or with SuSE 9.  They should
be available from http://packman.links2linux.org/ .
