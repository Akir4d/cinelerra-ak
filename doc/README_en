This is the Cinelerra CV Manual.

You may redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

It is based on "Secrets of Cinelerra", an excellent manual written by Heroine
Virtual Ltd. Alex Ferrer's TWiki contents was put in by Nicolas Maufrais, who
worked on the original cinelerra.texi file in order to generate nice manuals.

The manual sources are shipped with Cinelerra's source code. They are Texinfo 
files and can be easily converted to other formats.

To make the manuals in PDF, HTML (single page) HTML (one page per chapter, in a 
folder) and TXT formats just execute the script make_manuals.sh followed by the 
language code.

Example for converting the English manual:
	$ cd hvirtual/doc
	$ ./make_manuals.sh en

To get a folder with one file per chapter in DokuWiki sintax, type: 	
	$ cd hvirtual/doc
	$ ./make_wiki.sh en

Dependencies: 
To build the Manuals the following applications have to be installed on your computer:
texinfo
TeX (for Debian or Ubuntu: tetex-bin and tetex-base)
texi2html
html2wiki (HTML::WikiConverter, for Ubuntu: is called libhtml-wikiconverter-perl)

The manual can also be converted to Docbook, but you need the CVS version of
texinfo to do so. The "stable" version of Texinfo cannot produce a correct
Docbook file. If you have the binary of the CVS version of makeinfo available
on your computer, you can uncomment the corresponding lines in make_manuals.sh
That will produce a Docbook cinelerra.xml file which can be opened by yelp.
CAUTION: Do not deinstall your current stable version of texinfo. If you want
to look at the manual in yelp, just download the texinfo CVS sources and make
the binaries. Here is what you should do:
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/texinfo co texinfo
$ cd texinfo
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
$ make

You will get compilation errors. Do not worry about that. Do *NOT* proceed to
the makeinfo CVS install. All you need is the makeinfo binary, which is in the
makeinfo folder.  Rename it to makeinfo_cvs for example and copy it your path.
